# Arachne

Arachne is a lightweight, minimalistic, zero dependencies networking layer for apps using [Combine](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine) developed in Swift, that provides an opinionated abstraction layer to remove boilerplate code.

Arachne aims to expose a Combine [Publisher](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/combine/publisher) even for `URLSession` tasks that don't have one yet.

This library's design was inspired by [Moya](https://github.com/Moya/Moya), but differently from Moya, Arachne uses only the standard [Foundation framework](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/foundation/url_loading_system) (e.g. `URLSession`).

This makes Arachne suitable for recently created or migrated apps that make use of Apple's frameworks, instead of third party ones, like [Alamofire](https://github.com/Alamofire/Alamofire) or [RxSwift](https://github.com/ReactiveX/RxSwift).

## Usage

You start by defining your APIs like this

```swift
import Foundation
import Arachne

enum MyAPIService {
    case info
    case userProfile(username: String)
    case postEndpoint(body: MyCodableObject, limit: Int)
}

extension MyAPIService: ArachneService {

    var baseUrl: String {
        switch self {
        default:
            return "https://myapiservice.com"
        }
    }

    var path: String {
        switch self {
        case .info:
            return "/info"
        case .userProfile(let username):
            return "/users/\(username)"
        case .postEndpoint:
            return "/postendpoint"
        }
    }

    var queryStringItems: [URLQueryItem]? {
        switch self {
        case .postEndpoint(_, let limit):
            return [
                URLQueryItem(name: "limit", value: "\(limit)")
            ]
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }

    var method: HttpMethod {
        switch self {
        case .postEndpoint:
            return .post
        default:
            return .get
        }
    }

    var body: Data? {
        switch self{
        case .postEndpoint(let myCodableObject, _):
            return try? JSONEncoder().encode(myCodableObject)
        default:
            return nil
        }
    }

    var headers: [String : String]? {
        switch self {
        case .postEndpoint:
            return nil
        default:
            return ["Accept" : "application/json"]
        }
    }

}
```

Then you can use them like this

```swift
import Combine
import SwiftUI

struct Info: Codable {
    let name: String
}

class MyApiClient {
    private let provider = ArachneProvider<MyAPIService>()

    func loadInfo() -> AnyPublisher<Info, Error> {
        return provider.request(.info)
            .decode(type: Info.self, decoder: JSONDecoder())
            .eraseToAnyPublisher()
    }
}

class MyInteractor: ObservableObject {
    private let apiClient = MyApiClient()
    private var cancellables = Set<AnyCancellable>()

    @Published var info: Info?

    func getInfo() {
        apiClient.loadInfo()
            .sink { completion in
                switch completion {
                case .finished:
                    break
                case .failure(let error):
                    NSLog("Error: \(error.localizedDescription)")
                }
            } receiveValue: { info in
                self.info = info
            }
            .store(in: &cancellables)
    }
}

struct MyView: View {
    @ObservedObject var interactor: MyInteractor

    var body: some View {
        Text(interactor.info?.name ?? "")
            .onAppear {
                interactor.getInfo()
            }
    }
}
```

## Installation

### Swift Package Manager

#### Using Xcode UI

Go to your Project Settings -> Swift Packages and add Arachne from there.

#### Not using Xcode UI

Add the following as a dependency to your `Package.swift`:

```swift
.package(url: "https://github.com/artemisia-absynthium/arachne.git", .upToNextMajor(from: "0.2.0"))
```
and then specify "Arachne" as a dependency of the Target in which you wish to use it.

### Cocoapods

_Note: If you can choose, please use Swift Package Manager, support for Cocoapods may be discontinued in future versions of this library_

Add the following entry to your `Podfile`:

```ruby
pod 'Arachne'
```

## Roadmap

Currently supported tasks are
* `dataTask`
* `downloadTask`

Next step will be to add the remaining tasks üöß

## Why Arachne?

Thinking about networking my mind immediately went to the best "networkers" in nature: spiders.

Since I come from classical studies background I liked to use the Greek word for spider: Arachne (·æ∞ÃìœÅ·æ∞ÃÅœáŒΩŒ∑). Arachne is also the name of the protagonist, a very talented weaver, of [a tale in Greek mythology](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arachne) and I felt it was really appropriate.
