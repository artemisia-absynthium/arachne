# Product Mission (Lite)

Arachne is a Swift networking library that helps developers use async/await URLSession tasks on older OS versions and provides an abstraction layer to reduce boilerplate code for common networking operations.

Arachne targets Swift developers building apps for iOS 13+, macOS 10.15+, tvOS 13+, watchOS 7+, visionOS 1+, macCatalyst 13+, driverKit 19+ who need backported modern features with zero dependencies. Unlike heavier libraries, Arachne offers a minimalistic, opinionated API that mimics Apple's while allowing extensions for custom logic, ensuring compatibility and simplicity.
