## 2023-10-01: Initial Product Planning

**ID:** DEC-001
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Product
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner

### Decision

Develop Arachne as a lightweight Swift networking library that backports async/await URLSession tasks to older OS versions, provides an opinionated abstraction to reduce boilerplate, targeting Swift developers needing minimal dependencies and compatibility.

### Context

With the introduction of async/await in Swift, developers targeting older OS versions face challenges in adopting modern concurrency without complex conditional code. There's a market opportunity for a zero-dependency library that simplifies networking while mimicking Apple's API.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Extend Existing Libraries (e.g., Moya or Alamofire)**
   - Pros: Established user base, more features.
   - Cons: Adds dependencies, doesn't focus on backporting, heavier footprint.

2. **Build from Scratch with Combine Focus**
   - Pros: Could support older reactive patterns.
   - Cons: Combine is being phased out in favor of async/await, less future-proof.

### Rationale

Choosing a minimalistic, Foundation-only approach ensures broad compatibility and ease of adoption. The design prioritizes common cases with easy extensibility, aligning with Apple's ecosystem.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- Easy integration for developers.
- Low maintenance due to no dependencies.

**Negative:**

- May require community contributions for niche features.
- Initial development time for backporting.

## 2023-10-02: API Design Principles

**ID:** DEC-002
**Status:** Accepted
**Category:** Technical
**Stakeholders:** Product Owner

### Decision

Design the API to mimic Apple's URLSession API for common cases while allowing generation of plain URLRequests for custom use cases, and support plugins for custom logic before and after calls in success or error scenarios.

### Context

To balance ease of use for standard networking tasks with flexibility for uncommon scenarios, ensuring the library is both approachable and extensible.

### Alternatives Considered

1. **Rigid Abstraction Only**
   - Pros: Simpler to learn.
   - Cons: Limits usability for edge cases.

2. **Fully Customizable Low-Level API**
   - Pros: Maximum flexibility.
   - Cons: Increases boilerplate, defeating the library's purpose.

### Rationale

This approach makes common cases easy while keeping uncommon possible, aligning with the library's goal of reducing boilerplate without sacrificing power.

### Consequences

**Positive:**

- High developer satisfaction for varied use cases.
- Encourages best practices through opinionated defaults.

**Negative:**

- Slightly steeper learning curve for plugin system.
